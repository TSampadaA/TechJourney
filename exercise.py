Create a list of your favourite things. Ask the user for their favorite out of that. If the item is not in the lis,
tell the user you’re not familiar with that. If the item is the first in your list, let them know it’s your favorite too.
Otherwise, just print something.


Ask the user for a number between 1 and 100. Create a random number.
While the user hasn’t correctly guessed the number, tell them if their guess was higher or lower. Ask them for a new guess and loop again. 
Congratulate them when they win! 


**If extra time: keep track of how many guesses it took the user. Or limit the user to a certain number of guesses.**


Create a program that asks the user how many times a coin will be heads when flipped 100 times. 
Use a loop to flip the coin 100 times and generate a random number between 0 and 1 to determine heads or tails. 
When the loop is done, print out the number of times the coin was heads vs tails. Let the user know if their guess was correct!
